# FocusFlow Authentication Roadmap

## Current State (main branch) ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Production ready for personal/home server use
- **Security Level**: Basic (name + email only)
- **Use Case**: Personal productivity, trusted environments
- **Deployment**: Home servers, personal use

### Features:
- ‚úÖ Simple name/email login
- ‚úÖ Automatic user creation
- ‚úÖ LocalStorage sessions
- ‚úÖ Basic user management
- ‚úÖ Works immediately

## Phase 2: Enhanced Security (enhanced-auth branch) üîÑ

### Priority 1: Session Security
- [ ] JWT tokens instead of localStorage
- [ ] Session expiry (configurable: 1-7 days)
- [ ] Secure httpOnly cookies
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Session refresh mechanism

### Priority 2: Optional Authentication Methods
- [ ] **Option A**: Simple PIN (4-6 digits)
- [ ] **Option B**: Basic password with bcrypt
- [ ] **Option C**: Magic link via email
- [ ] Configurable auth method via environment variable

### Priority 3: User Management
- [ ] User roles (admin, user, viewer)
- [ ] Admin panel for user management
- [ ] Bulk user creation (CSV import)
- [ ] User activity logging
- [ ] Password reset functionality

### Priority 4: Organization Features
- [ ] Multi-tenant support
- [ ] Organization-level settings
- [ ] Team/department grouping
- [ ] Organization admin roles
- [ ] Usage analytics per organization

## Phase 3: Enterprise Ready üè¢

### Advanced Authentication
- [ ] SAML/SSO integration
- [ ] LDAP authentication
- [ ] Active Directory integration
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (TOTP)
- [ ] OAuth provider options (GitHub, Microsoft)

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] Audit trail logging
- [ ] GDPR compliance features
- [ ] Data export/import
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] IP allowlisting
- [ ] Security headers

### Deployment Options
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] One-click deployment scripts
- [ ] Database migration tools
- [ ] Backup/restore utilities

## Configuration Strategy

### Environment-Based Security Levels
```bash
# Personal (current)
AUTH_LEVEL=simple
AUTH_METHOD=email_only

# Enhanced (phase 2)
AUTH_LEVEL=enhanced
AUTH_METHOD=password|pin|magic_link
SESSION_DURATION=24h

# Enterprise (phase 3)
AUTH_LEVEL=enterprise
AUTH_METHOD=sso|ldap|oauth
REQUIRE_2FA=true
```

## Migration Path
1. **Keep main branch stable** - always deployable
2. **Develop on enhanced-auth** - no pressure, can experiment
3. **Feature flags** - gradually enable new features
4. **Backwards compatibility** - existing simple auth still works
5. **Config-driven** - choose security level at deployment time

## Timeline Suggestion
- **Now**: Use main branch, get off Pomodone! üéâ
- **Next 2-4 weeks**: Develop enhanced-auth when you have time
- **Later**: Enterprise features as needed

## Use Case Matrix
| Use Case | Branch | Security Level | Auth Method |
|----------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Personal home server | main | Simple | Name + Email |
| Small team (5-10 people) | enhanced-auth | Enhanced | PIN or Password |
| School/Organization | enhanced-auth | Enhanced | Password + Roles |
| Enterprise deployment | enterprise-auth | Full | SSO + 2FA |

This way you get immediate productivity gains while building toward something that could serve schools and organizations properly!
